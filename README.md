### Hi there 👋 

Welcome to my GitHub repo!\
Here you'll find garbage I hack around on, but more importanly you'll find the source for images provided on my Docker Hub account [shaker242](https://hub.docker.com/u/shaker242) and in-progress content related to the [OCPdude YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OCPdude).

Looking for the OCPdude GitHub repo? [Click Here](https://github.com/ocpdude)

If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects, please do! I enjoy learning and collaborating!

When I'm not hacking or gaming, I'm on an adventure as an avid wilderness backpacker. Being on the east coast provides fantastic access to the Blue Ridge, Shenandoah, and Smoky Mountains, along with many wilderness areas along the Appalachians. 🥾 🏕

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find garbage I hack around on, but more importanly you'll find the source for images provided on my Docker Hub account [shaker242](https://hub.docker.com/u/shaker242) and content related to my [OCPdude YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OCPdude).

Regarding OCPdude: I highly recommend that if you need assistance with OpenShift, contact your support channels directly.

If you'd like to collaborate on any of these projects, please do! We learn and deveop better skills when we are a team.

When I'm not hacking or gaming, I'm on an adventure as an avid wilderness backpacker.

Upcoming lectures/events:
18/FEB/22 - The Engineening Design Process, Lakeville, MA

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find garbage I hack around on, but more importanly you'll find the source for images provided on my Docker Hub account [shaker242](https://hub.docker.com/u/shaker242) and content related to my [OCPdude YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OCPdude).

Regarding OCPdude: I highly recommend that if you need assistance with OpenShift, you contact your support channels directly. The YouTube channel is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

If you'd like to collaborate on any of these project repos, please do! I believe we learn and develop valuable skills when we act as a team.

When I'm not hacking or gaming, I'm on an adventure as an avid wilderness backpacker. Being on the east coast provides fantastic access to the Blue Ridge, Shenandoah, and Smoky Mountains, along with many wilderness areas along the Appalachians.

Upcoming lectures/events:
18/FEB/22 - The Engineening Design Process, Lakeville, MA

Ask me about [VuWing](https://vuwing.com)! As the founder, inventor and company president, I'm always excited to talk about the product journey.

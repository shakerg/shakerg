Here you'll find garbage I hack around on, but more importanly you'll find the source for images provided on my Docker Hub account [shaker242](https://hub.docker.com/u/shaker242) and in-progress content related to the [OCPdude YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OCPdude).

Looking for the OCPdude GitHub repo? [Click Here](https://github.com/ocpdude)

If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects, please do! I enjoy learning and collaborating!
